# NS3-802.11ac-mimo-Test
This a c++ code for ns3. 
Simulation a 802.11ac with mimo, here the station and the access point is fixed.
TCP connection is used.
No of stations can be increased in the program.
In mimo setup the distance is not considered.


##--------------MIMO SETUP----------------##
rss = -54
shortguardinterval = true
channelboanding = true
antennas = 4
MaxsupportedTxSpatialStreams = 1
MaxsupportedRxSpatialStreams = 1
channelboanding = 40 (Mhz)

##--------------OUTPUT-------------------##
1. Avarage Throughput
2. Delay
3. Packet Lost
